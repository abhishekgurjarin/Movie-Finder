#  Movie Finder Website

### Introduction

 we will walk through the process of building a Movie Finder website using React and the OMDB API. The website allows users to browse movies by categories like Avengers, Star Wars, and Series, and search for movies using specific queries. Each movie has its detail page, making it easy to explore more about your favorite films.

### Project Overview

**Movie Finder Website** enables users to:
- Browse categories like Avengers and Star Wars.
- Search for movies by keywords.
- View detailed movie information (poster, genre, director, actors, and more).
- Navigate easily through the website with a clean, modern design.

### Features

- Fetch data dynamically using the OMDB API.
- Responsive design for a better user experience.
- Search functionality that provides instant results.
- Loading indicators while data is being fetched.
- View details of individual movies on a separate page.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building UI components.
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the OMDB API.
- **OMDB API**: To fetch movie details.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

### Project Structure

### Conclusion

In this blog, we learned how to create a Movie Finder website using React, React Router, and Axios. This project demonstrates how to interact with a public API, manage state in React, and create a simple yet functional movie browsing experience.

Feel free to customize the design and add more features, like user reviews or movie ratings, to make it more dynamic!
